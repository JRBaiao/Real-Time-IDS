# Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview

This project implements a **Real-Time Intrusion Detection System** designed to monitor network traffic and detect anomalous behavior indicative of potential cyber-attacks. Using machine learning techniques, specifically anomaly detection algorithms, the system analyzes network packets in real-time to identify suspicious activities and raise alerts promptly.

---

## Features

* **Real-time traffic monitoring:** Continuously captures and inspects network packets.
* **Anomaly detection:** Uses Isolation Forest (or other models) to identify unusual patterns.
* **Traffic analysis:** Extracts relevant features from network flows for effective detection.
* **Alert system:** Generates alerts when potential intrusions or anomalies are detected.
* **Extensible:** Easily integrable with other security tools and customizable for various network environments.
* **User-friendly interface:** Optional GUI or command-line interface for monitoring and management.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Packet Capture:** `scapy`, `pyshark`, or similar libraries
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (Isolation Forest or other algorithms)
* **Data Processing:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib` or `seaborn` (optional)
* **Others:** `socket`, `threading` for real-time capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-ids.git
   cd real-time-ids
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the IDS script to start real-time monitoring:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Configure detection parameters (optional) via `config.yaml` or CLI arguments.

3. Monitor console output or logs for alerts on suspicious activities.

## How It Works

* The system captures network packets in real time.
* Extracted features (e.g., packet size, source/destination IP, protocol, time intervals) feed into the anomaly detection model.
* The trained Isolation Forest model classifies traffic as normal or anomalous.
* Detected anomalies trigger alerts for further investigation.

---

## Dataset & Training

* The model is trained on benchmark network datasets such as KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD, or custom collected traffic.
* Training scripts and preprocessing tools are included in the `/training` directory.
* Pre-trained model files are available in `/models`.
